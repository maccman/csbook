<title>Creating Applications</title>
 
  
  <para>
    Now you've been given an overview of the syntax, lets explore
    actually structuring and creating CoffeeScript applications. This
    section aims to be useful to all CoffeeScript developers, novice or
    advanced. Indeed, it should be relevant to pure JavaScript
    developers too.
  </para>
  <para>
    For some reason, when developers are building client side JavaScript
    applications, tried and tested patterns and conventions often fly
    out the window, and the end result is a spaghetti mess of
    un-maintainable coupled JavaScript. I can't stress enough how
    important application architecture is; if you're writing any
    JavaScript/CoffeeScript beyond simple form validation you should
    implement a form of application structure, such as
    <ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</ulink>.
  </para>
  <para>
    The secret to building maintainable large applications is not to
    build large applications. In other words, build a series of modular
    de-coupled components. Keep application logic as generic as
    possible, abstracting it out as appropriate. Lastly separate out
    your logic into views, models and controllers (MVC). Implementing
    MVC is beyond the scope of this chapter, for that I recommend you
    check out my book on
    <ulink url="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781449307530/">JavaScript
    Web Applications</ulink> and use a framework like
    <ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone</ulink>
    or <ulink url="https://github.com/maccman/spine">Spine</ulink>.
    Rather than that, here we're going to cover structuring applications
    using CommonJS modules.
  </para>
  <sect1>
    <title>Structure &amp; CommonJS</title>
    <para>
      So what exactly are CommonJS modules? Well, If you've used
      <ulink url="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</ulink> before you've used
      CommonJS modules, probably without realizing it. CommonJS modules
      were initially developed for writing server-side JavaScript
      libraries, in an attempt to deal with loading, namespacing and
      scoping issues. They were a common format that would be compatible
      across all JavaScript implementations. The aim was that a library
      written for
      <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</ulink> would
      work for Node. Eventually these ideas transitioned back to
      browsers, and now we have great libraries like
      <ulink url="http://requirejs.org">RequireJS</ulink> and
      <ulink url="https://github.com/jbrantly/yabble">Yabble</ulink> to
      help us use modules client-side.
    </para>
    <para>
      Practically speaking, modules ensure that your code is run in a
      local namespace (code encapsulation), that you can load other
      modules with the <literal>require()</literal> function, and expose
      module properties via <literal>module.exports</literal>. Let's
      dive into that in a bit more depth now.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Requiring files</title>
      <para>
        You can load in other modules and libraries using
        <literal>require()</literal>. Simply pass a module name and, if
        it's in the load path, it'll return an object representing that
        module. For example:
      </para>
      <screen>
User = require("models/user")
</screen>
      <para>
        Synchronous require support is a contentious issue, but has
        mostly been resolved with the mainstream loader libraries and
        latest CommonJS
        <ulink url="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/AsynchronousDefinition">proposals</ulink>.
        It may be something you'll have to look into if you decided to
        take a separate route than the one I'm advocating with Stitch
        below.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Exporting properties</title>
      <para>
        By default, modules don't expose any properties so their
        contents are completely invisible to
        <literal>require()</literal> calls. If you want a particular
        property to be accessible from your module, you'll need to set
        it on <literal>module.exports</literal>:
      </para>
      <screen>
# random_module.js
module.exports.myFineProperty = -&gt;
  # Some shizzle
</screen>
      <para>
        Now, whenever this module is required then
        <literal>myFineProperty</literal> will be exposed:
      </para>
      <screen>
myFineProperty = require("random_module").myFineProperty
</screen>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>Stitch it up</title>
    <para>
      Formatting your code as CommonJS modules is all fine and dandy,
      but how do you actually get this working on the client in
      practice? Well, my method of choice is the rather unheard of
      <ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch">Stitch</ulink>
      library. Stitch is by Sam Stephenson, the mind behind
      <ulink url="http://www.prototypejs.org">Prototype.js</ulink>
      amongst other things, and solves the module problem so elegantly
      it makes me want to dance for joy! Rather than try to dynamically
      resolve dependencies, Stitch simply bundles up all your JavaScript
      files into one, wrapping them in some CommonJS magic. Oh, and did
      I mention it'll compile your CoffeeScript, JS templates,
      <ulink url="http://lesscss.org">LESS CSS</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</ulink> files too!
    </para>
    <para>
      First things first, you'll need to install
      <ulink url="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://npmjs.org/">npm</ulink> if you haven't already,
      we'll be using those throughout this chapter.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now let's create our application structure. If you're using
      <ulink url="https://github.com/maccman/spine">Spine</ulink>, you
      can automate this with
      <ulink url="http://github.com/maccman/spine.app">Spine.App</ulink>,
      otherwise it's something you'll need to do manually. I usually
      have an <literal>app</literal> folder for all the application
      specific code, and a <literal>lib</literal> folder for general
      libraries. Then anything else, including static assets, goes in
      the <literal>public</literal> directory.
    </para>
    <screen>
app
app/controllers
app/views
app/models
app/lib
lib
public
public/index.html
</screen>
    <para>
      Now to actually boot up the Stitch server. Let's create a file
      called <literal>index.coffee</literal> and fill it with the
      following script:
    </para>
    <screen>
require("coffee-script")
stitch  = require("stitch")
express = require("express")
argv    = process.argv.slice(2)

package = stitch.createPackage(
  # Specify the paths you want Stitch to automatically bundle up
  paths: [ __dirname + "/app" ]

  # Specify your base libraries
  dependencies: [
    # __dirname + '/lib/jquery.js'
  ]
)
app = express.createServer()

app.configure -&gt;
  app.set "views", __dirname + "/views"
  app.use app.router
  app.use express.static(__dirname + "/public")
  app.get "/application.js", package.createServer()

port = argv[0] or process.env.PORT or 9294
console.log "Starting server on port: #{port}"
app.listen port
</screen><para>Compiles down to:</para><screen>(function() {
  var app, argv, express, package, port, stitch;

  require("coffee-script");

  stitch = require("stitch");

  express = require("express");

  argv = process.argv.slice(2);

  package = stitch.createPackage({
    paths: [__dirname + "/app"],
    dependencies: []
  });

  app = express.createServer();

  app.configure(function() {
    app.set("views", __dirname + "/views");
    app.use(app.router);
    app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"));
    return app.get("/application.js", package.createServer());
  });

  port = argv[0] || process.env.PORT || 9294;

  console.log("Starting server on port: " + port);

  app.listen(port);

}).call(this);
</screen>
    <para>
      You can see some dependencies listed:
      <literal>coffee-script</literal>, <literal>stitch</literal> and
      <literal>express</literal>. We need to create a
      <literal>package.json</literal> file, listing these dependencies
      so npm can pick them up. Our <literal>./package.json</literal>
      file will look like this:
    </para>
    <screen>
{
  "name": "app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "dependencies": { 
    "coffee-script": "~1.1.2",
    "stitch": "~0.3.2",
    "express": "~2.5.0",
    "eco": "1.1.0-rc-1"
  }
}
</screen>
    <para>
      And let's install those dependencies with npm:
    </para>
    <screen>
npm install .
npm install -g coffee-script
</screen>
    <para>
      Rightio, we're almost there. Now run:
    </para>
    <screen>
coffee index.coffee
</screen>
    <para>
      You'll hopefully have a Stitch server up and running. Let's go
      ahead and test it out by putting an <literal>app.coffee</literal>
      script in the <literal>app</literal> folder. This will be the file
      that'll bootstrap our application.
    </para>
    <screen>
module.exports = App =
  init: -&gt;
    # Bootstrap the app
</screen><para>Compiles down to:</para><screen>(function() {
  var App;

  module.exports = App = {
    init: function() {}
  };

}).call(this);
</screen>
    <para>
      Now let's create our main page <literal>index.html</literal>
      which, if we're building a single page app, will be the only page
      the user actually navigates to. This is a static asset, so it's
      located under the <literal>public</literal> directory.
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset=utf-8&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Application&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- Require the main Stitch file --&gt;
  &lt;script src="/application.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(){
      var App = require("app");
      App.init();
    }, false);
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      When the page loads, our <emphasis>DOMContentLoaded</emphasis>
      event callback is requiring the <literal>app.coffee</literal>
      script (which is automatically compiled), and invoking our
      <literal>init()</literal> function. That's all there is to it,
      we've got CommonJS modules up and running, as well as a HTTP
      server and CoffeeScript compiler. If, say, we wanted to include a
      module, it's just a case of calling <literal>require()</literal>.
      Let's create a new class, <literal>User</literal>, and reference
      it from <literal>app.coffee</literal>:
    </para>
    <screen>
# app/models/user.coffee
module.exports = class User
  constructor: (@name) -&gt;

# app/app.coffee
User = require("models/user")
</screen><para>Compiles down to:</para><screen>(function() {
  var User;

  module.exports = User = (function() {

    function User(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    return User;

  })();

  User = require("models/user");

}).call(this);
</screen>
  </sect1>
  <sect1>
    <title>JavaScript templates</title>
    <para>
      If you're moving logic to the client side, then you'll definitely
      need some sort of templating library. JavaScript templating is
      very similar to templates on the server, such as Ruby's ERB or
      Python's text interpolation, except of course it runs client side.
      There are a whole host of templating libraries out there, so I
      encourage you to do some research and check them out. By default,
      Stitch comes with support for
      <ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</ulink>
      templates baked right in.
    </para>
    <para>
      JavaScript templates are very similar to server side ones. You
      have template tags interoperated with HTML, and during rendering
      those tags get evaluated and replaced. The great thing about
      <ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/eco">Eco</ulink>
      templates, is they're actually written in CoffeeScript.
    </para>
    <para>
      Here's an example:
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;% if @projects.length: %&gt;
  &lt;% for project in @projects: %&gt;
    &lt;a href="&lt;%= project.url %&gt;"&gt;&lt;%= project.name %&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= project.description %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% else: %&gt;
  No projects
&lt;% end %&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      As you can see, the syntax is remarkably straightforward. Just use
      <literal>&lt;%</literal> tags for evaluating expressions, and
      <literal>&lt;%=</literal> tags for printing them. A partial list
      of template tags is as follows:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>&lt;% expression %&gt;</literal><literallayout></literallayout>
          Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression without printing its return
          value.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>&lt;%= expression %&gt;</literal><literallayout></literallayout>
          Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression, escape its return value,
          and print it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          <literal>&lt;%- expression %&gt;</literal><literallayout></literallayout>
          Evaluate a CoffeeScript expression and print its return value
          without escaping it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      You can use any CoffeeScript expression inside the templating
      tags, but there's one thing to look out for. CoffeeScript is
      whitespace-sensitive, but your Eco templates aren't. Therefore,
      Eco template tags that begin an indented CoffeeScript block must
      be suffixed with a colon. To indicate the end of an indented
      block, use the special tag <literal>&lt;% end %&gt;</literal>. For
      example:
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;% if @project.isOnHold(): %&gt;
  On Hold
&lt;% end %&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      You don't need to write the <literal>if</literal> and
      <literal>end</literal> tags on separate lines:
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;% if @project.isOnHold(): %&gt; On Hold &lt;% end %&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      And you can use the single-line postfix form of
      <literal>if</literal> as you'd expect:
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;%= "On Hold" if @project.isOnHold() %&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      Now we've got a handle on the syntax, let's define an Eco template
      in <literal>views/users/show.eco</literal>:
    </para>
    <screen>
&lt;label&gt;Name: &lt;%= @name %&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
</screen>
    <para>
      Stitch will automatically compile our template and include it in
      <literal>application.js</literal>. Then, in our application's
      controllers we can require the template, like it was a module, and
      execute it passing any data required.
    </para>
    <screen>
require("views/users/show")(new User("Brian"))
</screen><para>Compiles down to:</para><screen>
  require("views/users/show")(new User("Brian"));
</screen>
    <para>
      Our <literal>app.coffee</literal> file should now look like this,
      rendering the template and appending it to the page when the
      document loads:
    </para>
    <screen>
User = require("models/user")

App =
  init: -&gt;
    template = require("views/users/show")
    view     = template(new User("Brian"))

    # Obviously this could be spruced up by jQuery
    element = document.createElement("div")
    element.innerHTML = view
    document.body.appendChild(element)

module.exports = App
</screen><para>Compiles down to:</para><screen>(function() {
  var App, User;

  User = require("models/user");

  App = {
    init: function() {
      var element, template, view;
      template = require("views/users/show");
      view = template(new User("Brian"));
      element = document.createElement("div");
      element.innerHTML = view;
      return document.body.appendChild(element);
    }
  };

  module.exports = App;

}).call(this);
</screen>

      Open up <ulink url="http://localhost:9294/">the
      application</ulink> and give it a whirl! Hopefully this tutorial
      has given you a good idea of how to structure client-side
      CoffeeScript applications. For your next steps, I recommend
      checking out a client-side framework like
      <ulink url="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone</ulink>
      or <ulink url="http://spinejs.com">Spine</ulink>, They'll provide
      a basic MVC structure for you, freeing you up for the interesting

      <ulink url="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</ulink> is an incredibly
      awesome web host that manages all the servers and scaling for you,
      letting you get on with the exciting stuff (building awesome
      JavaScript applications). You'll need an account with Heroku for
      this tutorial to work, but the great news is that their basic plan
      is completely free. While traditionally a Ruby host, Heroku have
      recently released their Cedar stack, which includes Node support.
    </para>
    <para>
      Firstly we need to make a <literal>Procfile</literal>, which will
      inform Heroku about our application.
    </para>
    <screen>
echo "web: coffee index.coffee" &gt; Procfile

    </para>
    <screen>
git init
git add .
git commit -m "First commit"    
</screen>
    <para>
      And now to deploy the application, we'll use the
