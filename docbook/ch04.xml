<title>Automating CoffeeScript compilation</title>
 
  
  <para>
    An issue with CoffeeScript is that it puts another layer between you
    and JavaScript, and having to manually compile CoffeeScript files
    whenever they change quickly gets old. Fortunately CoffeeScript has
    some alternative forms of compilation which can make the development
    cycle somewhat smoother.
  </para>
  <para>
    As we covered in the first chapter, we can compile CoffeeScript
    files using the <literal>coffee</literal> executable:
  </para>
  <screen>
coffee --compile --output lib src
</screen>
  <para>
    In fact in the example above, all the <literal>.coffee</literal>
    files in <literal>src</literal> will be compiled &amp; their
    JavaScript outputted to the <literal>lib</literal> directory. Even
    calling that is a bit of a bore, so let's look into automating it.
  </para>
  <sect1>
    <title>Cake</title>
    <para>
      <ulink url="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/#cake">Cake</ulink>
      is a super simple build system along the lines of
      <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</ulink> and
      <ulink url="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</ulink>. The library
      is bundled with the <literal>coffee-script</literal> npm package,
      and available via an executable called <literal>cake</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can define tasks using CoffeeScript in a file called
      <literal>Cakefile</literal>. Cake will pick these up, and can be
      invoked by running <literal>cake [task] [options]</literal> from
      within the directory. To print a list of all the tasks and
      options, just type <literal>cake</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Tasks are defined using the <literal>task()</literal> function,
      passing a name, optional description and callback function. For
      example, create a file called <literal>Cakefile</literal>, and two
      directories, <literal>lib</literal> and <literal>src</literal>.
      Add the following to the <literal>Cakefile</literal>:
    </para>
    <screen>
//= CoffeeScript
fs = require 'fs'

{print} = require 'sys'
{spawn} = require 'child_process'

build = (callback) -&gt;
  coffee = spawn 'coffee', ['-c', '-o', 'lib', 'src']
  coffee.stderr.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    process.stderr.write data.toString()
  coffee.stdout.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    print data.toString()
  coffee.on 'exit', (code) -&gt;
    callback?() if code is 0

task 'build', 'Build lib/ from src/', -&gt;
  build()
</screen>
    <para>
      In the example above, we're defining a task called
      <literal>build</literal> that can be invoked by running:
      <literal>cake build</literal>. This runs the same command as the
      previous example, compiling all the CoffeeScript files in
      <literal>src</literal> to JavaScript in <literal>lib</literal>.
      You can now reference JavaScript files in the
      <literal>lib</literal> directory as per usual from your HTML:
    </para>
    <screen>
//= CoffeeScript
&lt;script src="lib/app.js" type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;      
</screen>
    <para>
      We're still having to manually run <literal>cake build</literal>
      whenever our CoffeeScript code changes, which is far from ideal.
      Luckily, the <literal>coffee</literal> command takes another
      option, <literal>--watch</literal>, which instructs it to watch a
      directory for changes and re-compiling as necessary. Let's define
      another task using that:
    </para>
    <screen>
//= CoffeeScript
task 'watch', 'Watch src/ for changes', -&gt;
  coffee = spawn 'coffee', ['-w', '-c', '-o', 'lib', 'src']
  coffee.stderr.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    process.stderr.write data.toString()
  coffee.stdout.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    print data.toString()
</screen>
    <para>
      If one task relies on another, you can run other tasks using
      <literal>invoke(name)</literal>. Let's add a utility task to our
      <literal>Cakefile</literal> which is going to both open
      <literal>index.html</literal> and start watching the source for
      changes.
    </para>
    <screen>
//= CoffeeScript
task 'open', 'Open index.html', -&gt;
  # First open, then watch
  spawn 'open', 'index.html'
  invoke 'watch'
</screen>
    <para>
      You can also define options for your task using the
      <literal>option()</literal> function, which takes a short name,
      long name and description.
    </para>
    <screen>
//= CoffeeScript
option '-o', '--output [DIR]', 'output dir'

task 'build', 'Build lib/ from src/', -&gt;
  # Now we have access to a `options` object
  coffee = spawn 'coffee', ['-c', '-o', options.output or 'lib', 'src']
  coffee.stderr.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    process.stderr.write data.toString()
  coffee.stdout.on 'data', (data) -&gt;
    print data.toString()
</screen>
    <para>
      As you can see, the task context now has access to an
      <literal>options</literal> object containing any data specified by
      the user. If we run <literal>cake</literal> without any other
      arguments, all the tasks and options will be listed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Cake's a great way of automating common tasks such as compiling
      CoffeeScript without going to the hassle of using bash or
      Makefiles. It's also worth taking a look at
      <ulink url="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/documentation/docs/cake.html">Cake's
      source</ulink>, a great example of CoffeeScript's expressiveness
      and beautifully documented alongside the code comments.

    <title>Server side support</title>
    <para>
      Using Cake for CoffeeScript compilation is fine for static sites,
      but for dynamic sites we might as well integrate CoffeeScript
      compilation into the request/response cycle. Various integration
      solutions already exist for the popular backend languages and
      frameworks, such as
      <ulink url="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</ulink> and
      <ulink url="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</ulink>.
    </para>
    <para>
      When it comes to Rails 3.1, CoffeeScript support comes via
      <ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">Sprockets
      &amp; the asset pipeline</ulink>. Add your CoffeeScript files
      under <literal>app/assets/javascripts</literal>, and Rails is
      smart enough to pre-compile them when they're requested.
      JavaScript &amp; CoffeeScript files are concatenated and bundled
      using special comment directives, meaning you can fetch all of
      your application's JavaScript with one request. When it comes to
      production, Rails will write the compiled output to disk, ensuring
      it's cached and fast to serve.
    </para>
    <para>
      Other Ruby options include Rack servers such as 37signal's
      <ulink url="http://pow.cx/">Pow</ulink> and Joshua Peek's
      <ulink url="http://josh.github.com/nack/">Nack</ulink>, both
      highly recommended if your application doesn't need Rail's other
      features and associated overhead.
    </para>
    <para>
      Django also has
      <ulink url="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-coffeescript/">support
      for CoffeeScript</ulink> through special template tags. It works
      with both inline code and external files.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both Ruby and Python pipe out to Node and the CoffeeScript lib
      behind the scenes when compiling CoffeeScript, so you'll need to
      have those installed during development. If you're using Node
      directly as a backend for your site, CoffeeScript integration is
      even simpler and you can use it for both the backend and frontend
      code. We're going to talk more about this in the next chapter,
      using
      <ulink url="https://github.com/sstephenson/stitch">Stitch</ulink>
      to serve all our client-side CoffeeScript.
